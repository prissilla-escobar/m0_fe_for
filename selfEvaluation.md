# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
1. Not very much right now. I don't understand when the i is not equal to a number.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
1. I definitely did not do well on googling and figuring everything out. If I did figure it out by googling, it took me an hour or longer. I want to ask if there is a go to area that shows javascript shortcuts just like there was one for mark down.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
1. Yes, I will definitely need to adjust my schedule. I believe for this weekend, however, as there seems to be too much to do during the week. I need to understand exactly what is happening when the index is not a number. I also need to practice conditional printing.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
1. I could not complete challenge 3 nor all of the practice questions on the For Statements lesson. I plan to talk to groupmates tomorrow, attend study hall and talk to my teacher. It is difficult when lessons go far into the day and it's too late to contact anyone.
